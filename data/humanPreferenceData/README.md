# Readme

This directory contains annotations for features that Hawkins et al. did not
annotate for, but are needed for our model: plurality, verb sense, etc. However, 
it does not contain their dataset- you must download it (`generated_pairs_with_results.csv`) 
from their [repository](https://github.com/taka-yamakoshi/neural_constructions/tree/master/DAIS/data) 
and then add it to this directory.
